_Understanding the relationship between the Event Loop and the Call Stack is crucial for grasping how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations. Here's an explanation of how they interact:_

# Call Stack

The Call Stack is a data structure used by JavaScript to keep track of function calls. When a function is called, it's added to the Call Stack, and when the function returns, it's removed from the Call Stack. This is how JavaScript knows what function is currently executing and what function should be executed next.

Example

`function foo() {
console.log('foo');
}

function bar() {
foo();
console.log('bar');
}

bar();`
Call Stack Execution:

- bar is pushed onto the stack.
- bar calls foo, so foo is pushed onto the stack.
- foo finishes execution and is popped from the stack.
- bar finishes execution and is popped from the stack.

# Event Loop

The Event Loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations, despite being single-threaded. It continuously checks the Call Stack and the Message Queue (also known as the Callback Queue). If the Call Stack is empty, it takes the first event from the Message Queue and pushes it to the Call Stack for execution.

Message Queue
The Message Queue is where callback functions (from asynchronous operations like setTimeout, Promises, or DOM events) are queued. These callbacks are waiting to be executed by the Event Loop once the Call Stack is clear.

Relationship Between Event Loop and Call Stack
Call Stack Execution: Functions are executed in a last-in, first-out manner. Synchronous code is executed first, filling and emptying the Call Stack.
Asynchronous Operations: When an asynchronous operation (like setTimeout) is completed, its callback is placed in the Message Queue.
Event Loop Checks: The Event Loop constantly checks if the Call Stack is empty.
Callback Execution: If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop takes the first callback from the Message Queue and pushes it onto the Call Stack, where it gets executed.

Example

console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
console.log('Timeout');
}, 0);

console.log('End');
Output:
Start
End
Timeout

Execution Flow:
console.log('Start') is executed and logged.
setTimeout is called, which schedules the callback to be added to the Message Queue after 0 milliseconds.
console.log('End') is executed and logged.
The Call Stack is now empty, so the Event Loop picks up the setTimeout callback from the Message Queue.
The setTimeout callback is pushed to the Call Stack and executed, logging Timeout.

---------------------------------------------------------
console.log('Start')
---------------------------------------------------------
                          ⬇️
---------------------------------------------------------
console.log('End')
---------------------------------------------------------
                          ⬇️
---------------------------------------------------------
                        Callback               [Callback]
---------------------------------------------------------
                          ⬇️
---------------------------------------------------------
console.log('Timeout')
---------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion
The Call Stack is responsible for executing functions, while the Event Loop ensures that asynchronous callbacks are executed when the Call Stack is empty. This relationship allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations efficiently, providing a seamless experience despite its single-threaded nature.
