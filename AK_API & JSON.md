# API (Application Programming Interface) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) are two related but distinct concepts:

**API: two application(language can be different or anything) communicate with each other through API**

- A set of defined rules and protocols for building software applications
- Enables different applications or systems to communicate with each other
- Specifies how to request and receive data, including formats, endpoints, and methods
- Can use various data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV

JSON:

- A lightweight, human-readable data interchange format
- Used for representing and exchanging data between applications or systems
- Consists of key-value pairs, arrays, and objects, making it easy to read and write
- Often used as the data format in API requests and responses

_Key differences:_

- API is a broader concept, defining the interface and communication protocols, while JSON is a specific data format used within APIs
- API can use various data formats, including JSON, while JSON is a specific format used for data representation and exchange

_To illustrate the difference:_

- API is like a restaurant menu, defining what dishes are available and how to order them
- JSON is like the ingredients and instructions for preparing a specific dish, used to exchange information between the kitchen and the customer

In summary, API defines the interface and communication protocols, while JSON is a data format used within APIs to represent and exchange data.
